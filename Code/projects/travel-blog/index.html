            <h5>River</h5>
            <p>Rivers rise and fall in response to rainfall or snowmelt. They are inherently dynamic, spreading out into floodplains, then shrinking during dry seasons. The plants and animals that live in and beside rivers have adapted to these seasonal changes. They rely on them for their survival. Any modifications to the natural variations of rivers lead to devastating loss of biodiversity.
